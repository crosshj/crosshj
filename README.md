Here are some of the major projects I have worked on outside of my day job:

First up has been my primary focus outside of work for more than a year now.

[fiug](https://github.com/crosshj/fiug), a new, cloud IDE without the cloud

And here are some past projects which I have not dusted off for a while.

[cents](https://github.com/crosshj/cents), a personal finance tool

[ha-bridge-js](https://github.com/crosshj/ha-bridge-js), a home automation tool, a rough javascript rewrite of a Java tool

[async-tree](https://github.com/crosshj/async-tree), an async-lib extension aimed at cleanly handling event chains - my first npm module

[footils](https://github.com/crosshj/footils), a kitchen sink js toolbox which needs more love - my second npm module
